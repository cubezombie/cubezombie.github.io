I'm torn about this site. I love the simplicity of it and the ability to write posts from a terminal. But there's some formatting that I want to do
and it seems like I can't make that happen. In my last post I used wanted an unordered list with some nested elements but I couldn't get Jekyll to do the
right thing with those nested elements. It did use different bullet points for them but didn't indent them like I was expecting. I really don't want to use something
like Wordpress since I really tired of using it. Are there any other minimal blogging platforms out there that would be a middle graound between Jekyll
and Wordpress? If anyone is actually reading this let me know!

My homelab upgrades are going very well! I have a new HP Z840 that I'm loading up with ram and fast storage. My current setup relies on an 11 year old Synology NAS
and while it's working perfectly it only has 5400rpm drives which makes building/updating vms a pretty long process, nevermind the wear and tear on the drives that are
pretty old as well. I don't think their quite as old as the NAS itself but they're definitely not new. I'm waiting for some drive sleds for Z840 so I can add some
2.5 900gb 10k drives I found on ebay. Once those are up and available I'll move all my vm images from the NAS to that faster storage. I think I'm going to keep the NAS
in rotation as an archive/vault. That means I'll need to move all my Plex media as well and run it on the fast storage with the old NAS just keeping a backup copy of 
everything. 

I've got a few more ideas I need to add to the Linux Lab in a Box project page. I haven't done much with it yet but I really need to get the lab upgraded and stable first. I'm not
going to let that take forever though. Once the drive sleds show up and the storage gets added I'll move the vm images off the nas and that's when I start back up on LLAB. I'm really
excited to get that started and see how far I can take it. I know that I'm probably going to need help with "gluing" things together so they're a slick program and not a collection
of playbooks and bash scripts. I really want this to be polished but I going by the mantra "Release early, release often" so I can build up some momentum! I can't wait to actually
have something so people can test it out!

That's it for now! I think I'll go update the LLAB project page!
