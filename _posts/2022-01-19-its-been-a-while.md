I keep forgetting I have this site until I log into github randomly and see it! I really want to do something here since I really love being able to blog from the command line. I won't commit to posting more since it may/may not happen but I'm starting on a new project at work that I'm pretty excited about involving Ansible so that does give me more motivation to post. Plus with the whole "New Year, New You" thing I'm doing over at The Daily Stoic this would be a good habit building exercise!
