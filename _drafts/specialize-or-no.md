Something I've thought about for years was do I want to specialize and focuse on
something other than the Linux Operating System. Throughout my career I've been
exposed to a lot of different technology and vendors. Things like storage,
network, firewall, databases, etc and the question keeps coming up. What if I
don't want to specialize? What if I want my speciality to be the Linux OS? In
the industry right now I feel like finding someone who *really* understands the
OS and how everything interacts together is a hard find. There's a ton of people
who do Linux very, very well but when you get a really complex problem that
involves multiple subsystems there's a gap there. It's a gap I decided I wanted
to fill many years ago, in fact when I started my current job I let them know my
thoughts on it and I wasn't interested in being a Linux/Windows sysadmin. I
wanted to be a Linux admin.
